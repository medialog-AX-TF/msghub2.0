      This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.\n
      Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.\n\n
      When to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- 
      Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- 
      Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- 
      Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\nKey features:\n- 
      You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress\n- 
      You can question or revise previous thoughts\n- 
      You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end\n- 
      You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- 
      Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- 
      Generates a solution hypothesis\n- 
      Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- 
      Repeats the process until satisfied\n- 
      Provides a correct answer\n\nParameters explained:\n- 
      thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:\n* 
      Regular analytical steps\n* Revisions of previous thoughts\n* 
      Questions about previous decisions\n* Realizations about needing more analysis\n* 
      Changes in approach\n* Hypothesis generation\n* Hypothesis verification\n- 
      next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end\n- 
      thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)\n- 
      total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)\n- 
      is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- 
      revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- 
      branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- 
      branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- 
      needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n\nYou should:\n
      1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n
      2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n
      3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n
      4. Express uncertainty when present\n
      5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n
      6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n
      7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n
      8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n
      9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution\n
      10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n

Only calls tools when they are necessary. If the USER's task is general or you already know the answer, just respond without calling tools.\n5. Before calling each tool, first explain to the USER why you are calling it.\n</tool_calling>\n\n<making_code_changes>\nWhen making code changes, NEVER output code to the USER, unless requested. Instead use one of the code edit tools to implement the change.\nUse the code edit tools at most once per turn.\nIt is *EXTREMELY* important that your generated code can be run immediately by the USER. To ensure this, follow these instructions carefully:\n1. Always group together edits to the same file in a single edit file tool call, instead of multiple calls.\n2. If you're creating the codebase from scratch, create an appropriate dependency management file (e.g. requirements.txt) with package versions and a helpful README.\n3. If you're building a web app from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI, imbued with best UX practices.\n4. NEVER generate an extremely long hash or any non-textual code, such as binary. These are not helpful to the USER and are very expensive.\n5. Unless you are appending some small easy to apply edit to a file, or creating a new file, you MUST read the the contents or section of what you're editing before editing it.\n6. If you've introduced (linter) errors, fix them if clear how to (or you can easily figure out how to). Do not make uneducated guesses. And DO NOT loop more than 3 times on fixing linter errors on the same file. On the third time, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n7. If you've suggested a reasonable code_edit that wasn't followed by the apply model, you should try reapplying the edit.\n</making_code_changes>\n\n\n<searching_and_reading>\nYou have tools to search the codebase and read files. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. If available, heavily prefer the semantic search tool to grep search, file search, and list dir tools.\n2. If you need to read a file, prefer to read larger sections of the file at once over multiple smaller calls.\n3. If you have found a reasonable place to edit or answer, do not continue calling tools. Edit or answer from the information you have found.\n</searching_and_reading>\n\nAnswer the user's request using the relevant tool(s), if they are available. Check that all the required parameters for each tool call are provided or can reasonably be inferred from context. IF there are no relevant tools or there are missing values for required parameters, ask the user to supply these values; otherwise proceed with the tool calls. If the user provides a specific value for a parameter (for example provided in quotes), make sure to use that value EXACTLY. DO NOT make up values for or ask about optional parameters. Carefully analyze descriptive terms in the request as they may indicate required parameter values that should be included even if not explicitly quoted.\n\n<user_info>\nThe user's OS version is win32 10.0.26100. The absolute path of the user's workspace is /e%3A/DEV/study/cursor_lens. The user's shell is C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe. \n</user_info>\n\nYou MUST use the following format when citing code regions or blocks:\n```12:15:app/components/Todo.tsx\n// ... existing code ...\n```\nThis is the ONLY acceptable format for code citations. The format is ```startLine:endLine:filepath where startLine and endLine are line numbers.\n",

"description": "생각을 통한 역동적이고 반영적인 문제 해결을 위한 상세한 도구.\n
      이 도구는 문제를 분석하는 데 있어 유연한 사고 과정을 활용하여 변화와 적응이 가능하도록 돕습니다.\n
      각 사고 단계는 기존의 통찰을 확장하거나, 의문을 제기하거나, 이해가 깊어짐에 따라 수정할 수 있습니다.\n\n
      이 도구를 사용할 시점:\n- 복잡한 문제를 단계별로 분석할 때\n- 수정이 필요한 기획 및 설계를 할 때\n- 
      과정에서 방향 수정이 필요할 가능성이 있는 분석을 수행할 때\n- 문제의 전체 범위가 처음부터 명확하지 않을 때\n- 
      여러 단계의 해결 과정이 필요한 문제를 다룰 때\n- 여러 단계에 걸쳐 문맥을 유지해야 하는 작업을 수행할 때\n- 
      불필요한 정보를 걸러내야 하는 상황에서\n\n주요 기능:\n- 
      진행 상황에 따라 total_thoughts(총 사고 단계 수)를 조정할 수 있음\n- 
      이전 사고 과정을 질문하거나 수정할 수 있음\n- 
      예상한 결론에 도달한 후에도 추가적인 사고를 진행할 수 있음\n- 
      불확실성을 표현하고 대체 접근 방식을 탐색할 수 있음\n- 
      모든 사고 과정이 선형적으로 진행될 필요는 없음 – 분기하거나 되돌아갈 수 있음\n- 
      해결책 가설을 생성할 수 있음\n- 
      연쇄적 사고(Chain of Thought) 과정을 기반으로 가설을 검증함\n- 
      만족할 만한 결과가 나올 때까지 반복 가능\n- 
      최종적으로 올바른 답을 제공함\n\n파라미터 설명:\n- 
      thought: 현재 진행 중인 사고 단계로, 다음을 포함할 수 있음:\n* 
      일반적인 분석 단계\n* 이전 사고 과정의 수정\n* 
      이전 결정에 대한 질문\n* 추가 분석이 필요하다는 깨달음\n* 
      접근 방식의 변경\n* 해결책 가설 생성\n* 가설 검증\n- 
      next_thought_needed: 현재 사고가 끝난 것처럼 보이더라도 추가적인 사고가 필요한 경우 true\n- 
      thought_number: 현재 사고 단계 번호 (필요하면 초기 설정된 총 단계 수를 초과할 수도 있음)\n- 
      total_thoughts: 필요한 사고 단계 수의 현재 예상치 (증가/감소 가능)\n- 
      is_revision: 현재 사고가 이전 사고를 수정하는 경우 true\n- 
      revises_thought: is_revision이 true일 경우, 수정하고 있는 사고 단계 번호\n- 
      branch_from_thought: 분기하는 경우, 분기 시작 지점이 되는 사고 단계 번호\n- 
      branch_id: 현재 분기 식별자 (있는 경우)\n- 
      needs_more_thoughts: 마지막 단계에 도달했지만 추가적인 사고가 필요하다고 판단될 경우 true\n\n사용 지침:\n
      1. 처음에는 필요한 사고 단계 수를 대략적으로 설정하되, 필요에 따라 조정할 준비를 해야 함\n
      2. 이전 사고 과정을 자유롭게 질문하거나 수정할 수 있음\n
      3. 예상한 '끝'에 도달했더라도 추가 사고가 필요하다면 망설이지 말 것\n
      4. 불확실한 점이 있을 경우 명확하게 표현할 것\n
      5. 이전 사고를 수정하는 경우 또는 새로운 경로로 분기하는 경우 이를 명확히 표시할 것\n
      6. 현재 단계에 불필요한 정보는 무시할 것\n
      7. 필요할 때 해결책 가설을 생성할 것\n
      8. 연쇄적 사고(Chain of Thought) 과정을 기반으로 가설을 검증할 것\n
      9. 만족할 만한 해결책이 나올 때까지 과정을 반복할 것\n
      10. 최종적으로 단일하고 올바른 답을 제공할 것\n
      11. next_thought_needed 값을 false로 설정하는 것은 정말로 완료되고 만족스러운 답을 얻었을 때만 할 것"
